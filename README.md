# Hotkeys Chords for Obsidian
This plugin allows you to set hotkey chords (i.e. a sequence of hotkeys) for Obsidian commands.
It was written in a hurry and may not work out as intended.
It has been tested with Obsidian 0.13.23, other versions may not work.

Please open an issue if something is unclear.
